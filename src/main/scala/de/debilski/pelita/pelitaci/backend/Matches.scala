/* For the first few games, a player should not get any immediate score updates
 * but only accumulate the what-if numbers. (Shown in a lighter colour in the UI.) After those first games, a more
 * elaborate guess on the playerâ€™s ranking is possible. And it might be possible to calculate the gained score for
 * those games in hindsight.
 * 
 * With the normalisation value of 400, we might then have an approximate start value of 1200 and a lower boundary of 0.
